The inauguration speech is treated as one of the most important speeches for U.S. Presidents. In this project, we applied texting mining techniques to explore what they said during their inauguration speech, what strategies they adopted, and what kind of emotion they intended to convey. Intriguingly, we identified a significant trend on their speaking strategy and interesting clusters of their topics.   


```{r,warning=FALSE,error=FALSE,echo=FALSE,include=FALSE,message=FALSE}

##Part 1: Sentence Analysis: \n

Starting from the easiest method, we analyze the number and length of sentences for each president to identify interesting trend.
```{r,warning=FALSE,include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
######Preparetion,Data Loading and Preliminary Analysis######
folder.path="../data/InauguralSpeeches/"

#Load Information and get order of president according to time
require(xlsx)
inau_infor<-read.xlsx("/Users/Elune/Desktop/demo/data/InaugurationInfo.xlsx", sheetName = "Sheet1")
order<-paste(inau_infor$File,"-",inau_infor$Term,sep= "")   

#Get all txt files and load them 
speeches=list.files(path = folder.path, pattern = "*.txt")
n<-length(speeches)
prez.out=substr(speeches, 6, nchar(speeches)-4)

text.list<-NULL
for (i in speeches){
  New_file<-paste(scan(paste(folder.path,i,sep = ""),what = "character"),collapse=" ")
  text.list<-rbind(text.list,New_file) 
}
rownames(text.list)<-prez.out

#reorder the matrix according to time sequence:
text.list<-data.frame(text.list[sapply(order,grep,prez.out),1])
rownames(text.list)<-order
```


```{r,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
#####Convert Paragraph to Sentences######

#Write function to get get word.cound for each senences:
sentence.get<-function(text) {
  sentences=sent_detect(text,
                        endmarks = c("?", ".", "!", "|",";"))
  
  if(length(sentences)>0){
    word.count=word_count(sentences)
  }
  return(word.count)
}

##get sentences for each speeach
sen_length<-apply(text.list,1,sentence.get)

##Use Precidency index to indicate the precident (for the clearer)
names(sen_length)<-c(1:58)
```
For the clear structure of our following analysis, represent each president by the index of term rather than their name. 

```{r}
tables<-as.matrix(order)
colnames(tables)<-c("President Name")
rownames(tables)<-c(1:58)
tables
```
\n
Then, we use plot to show the trend:
```{r,warning=FALSE}
beeswarm(sen_length,col=rainbow(58),pch=19, 
         method="hex", cex=0.5, horizontal=TRUE, 
         xlab="Sentence Length", ylab="Precidency Index", 
         main="Distribution of Sentence Length")
```
<font color=white>111</font> \n

The beeswarm plot indicates that from George Washington, presidents tend to use shorter sentences in their inauguration speech. \n

What??s the interpretation? As we know:  \n
\n

>**Shorter sentences are easier to follow**</center> \n

>**Shorter sentences make more sense**</center>   \n

>**Shorter sentences indicate approachability**</center>   \n

\n
That is, they focus more on the communication with the public. They try to make sure that the public understand what they indent to convey and build a down-to-earth image. Then we select several famous presidents in different historical period: George Washington(1), John Tyler(14) Abraham Lincoln(19) Franklin D. Roosevelt (38), John F. Kennedy (44) and Barack Obama (56) to make comparision.  The trend is evident. 
```{r,warning=FALSE}

#
ex1<-sen_length[c(1,14,19,38,44,56)]
beeswarm(ex1,col=rainbow(8),pch=19, 
         method="hex", cex=0.8, horizontal=TRUE, 
         xlab="Sentence Length", ylab="Precidency Index", 
         main="Distribution of Sentence Length")
```
<font color=white>111</font> \n

Based on the historical trend, we explore the contemporary era and focus on Donald Trump(58).
```{r,warning=FALSE}
###????
ex2<-sen_length[50:58]
beeswarm(ex2,col=rainbow(8),pch=19, 
         method="hex", cex=0.8, horizontal=TRUE, 
         xlab="Sentence Length", ylab="Precidency Index", 
         main="Distribution of Sentence Length")
```  
<font color=white>111</font> \n

From the above picture, we can??t detect significant difference between Trump and other presidents.  \n

####**Part 1 Conclusion:**  
\n
Presidents tend to use more shorter sentences to keep effective communication between them and the public. In terms of this, Trump is not heterogeneous and adopt the same speaking strategy.

##Part 2: Topic Modelling  \n

###2.1: Topic Allocation  \n

Besides how they give a speech, we may be also curious about what they say. Moreover, we are interested in how indicative their topics is to reveal the current situation of America. In part 2, we adopt topic modeling method to explore their speech topics and the weights on each topic for each president.
```{r,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
########Pre-processing the data#####


###we build the corup using our text.list 
docs<-Corpus(VectorSource(unlist(text.list)))
#remove potentially problematic symbols
docs <-tm_map(docs,content_transformer(tolower))
#remove punctuation
docs <- tm_map(docs, removePunctuation)
#Strip digits
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeNumbers)
#remove stopwords
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
#remove whitespace
docs <- tm_map(docs, stripWhitespace)
#Stem document
docs <- tm_map(docs,stemDocument)
dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(docs)


#####Topic Modelling by the LDA method#####

burnin <- 4000
iter <- 2000
thin <- 500
seed <-list(2003,5,63,100001,765)
nstart <- 5
best <- TRUE
#Number of topics
k <- 10
#Run LDA using Gibbs sampling
ldaOut <-LDA(dtm, k, method="Gibbs", control=list(nstart=nstart, 
                                                  seed = seed, best=best,
                                                  burnin = burnin, iter = iter, 
                                                  thin=thin))
ldaOut.topics <- as.matrix(topics(ldaOut))
ldaOut.terms <- as.matrix(terms(ldaOut,20))
topicProbabilities <- as.data.frame(ldaOut@gamma)
write.csv(topicProbabilities,file=paste("./TopicProbabilities1.csv"))
terms.beta=ldaOut@beta
terms.beta=scale(terms.beta)
topics.terms=NULL
for(i in 1:k){
  topics.terms=rbind(topics.terms, ldaOut@terms[order(terms.beta[i,], decreasing = TRUE)[1:7]])
}
#topics.terms
#ldaOut.terms
```
\n
I set the topic numbers to be 10 and I manually tag them as "Patriotism", "Liberty", "America", "Economy", "History", "WorkingFamilies","Greetings","ForeignPolicy", "Government" and "Unity" after analyzing the keywords for each topic. \n

<center>![10 Topics](../figs/topics.png)</center>
\n

For example, I manually set Topic 1 as ??Patriotism?? for the keywords: Nation, Duty, Patriot. And I tag topic 2 as ??Liberty??, since it contains keywords: People, Freedom, Right, Liberty; I tag Topic 3 as ??Government??, since it contains keywords like: Govern, Law, Congress, Secure; I tag Topic 9 as ??ForeignPolicy?? for the keywords: War, Nation, Peace, Import. Moreover, I tag Topic 14 as ??Unity?? for the keywords: One, Union, People, Can, State. 
```{r}
topics.hash<-c("Patriotism","Liberty","America","Economy","WorkingFamilies", "Greetings","History", "ForeignPolicy", "Government","Unity")
ldatopic<-as.vector(ldaOut.topics)
ldahash<-topics.hash[ldaOut.topics]
colnames(topicProbabilities)<-topics.hash
```
\n
Then, I use heatmap plot to see the weight allocation of topics for each president. And an indicative trend appears. 
```{r,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
heatmap.2(as.matrix(topicProbabilities), Rowv = FALSE,
          scale = "column", key=T, 
          col = bluered(60),
          cexRow = 0.9, cexCol = 0.9, margins = c(8, 8),
          trace = "none", density.info = "none")
abline(h=0.56,col="Blue",lwd=2)
abline(h=0.415,col="Cyan",lwd=2)
abline(h=0.32,col="Green",lwd=2)
abline(h=0.08,col="Yellow",lwd=2)
legend("topright",legend=c("Before 1860","1860 To 1945","1945 To 1968","1968 To Present"),lty = 1,col=c("Blue","Cyan","Green","Yellow"))
```
<font color=white>111</font> \n

Note that red color indicates more weights on that topic. From the heatmap, there is  interesting trend: presidents that in same era tends to have similar weight allocation among the topics. And when relating them with the America history, the results are not spurring and even indicative. 


####**Interpretation:**
The reference indicate different era. We can see, before 1860,which is the early years of the new American nation, presidents talked more about  ??Unity??, ??Government?? and ??Patriotism??. It reveals that in that period, presidents wanted to show the power of government and unify people to contribute to the new country. 

Between 1860 to1945, which is the period of American Civil War and the world wars, presidents tended to focus more on ??Economy??. This is reasonable since after several wars (especially after the Civil War), developing economy is the most urgent task.

And from 1945 to 1968, which is treated as the Post-war period, presidents needed to develop the economy and establish good diplomatic relationships, thus they talked more about ??Economy?? and ??Foreign Policy??. 

As for during the contemporary era, after severe problems have been released, presidents put their emphasis on individuals and even focus more the spiritual level so they usually talked about ??Liberty??, ??America?? and ??Working Families??. Moreover, they tend to focus on working families to gain more support.    



###2.2: Clustering of presidents according to topics
\n
```{r}
####Clustering
mydata<-as.matrix(topicProbabilities)
fit <- kmeans(mydata,4,nstart=20)
#fit$cluster[58]
clusplot(mydata, fit$cluster, color=TRUE, shade=TRUE, labels=2,lines = 0,main="Cluster plot of Presidents According to Topics")
```
<font color=white>111</font> \n

From the plot, we can see, the K-mean clustering provide support for our interpretation:   

>**Contemporaneous presidents are clustered in same group**</center> \n

This means that during different historical periods, America is faced with different challenges and presidents Inauguration speech will talk more about those challenges. We can gain information about current situations about America from president??s speech.
